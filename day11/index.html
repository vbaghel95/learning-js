                        Maharashtra state about the beginning of the eighteenth century and first stayed at Phuljhar in
                        Raipur district. From there Madan Singh, head of the family migrated to Banda of the present-day
                        Raigarh. The successor kings of Raigarh state after Maharaja Madan Singh were Maharaja Takhat

                        Maharaja Ghansyam Singh, Maharaja Bhupdev Singh, Maharaja Natwar Singh, and Maharaja Chakradhar
                        Singh. Truly speaking music, dance, and literature got fillip during the reign of Maharaja
                        Bhupdev Singh and developed further during the rule of Maharaja Chakradhar Singh.[2] Prior to
                        Indian Independence, Raigarh was capital of Princely State of Raigarh.[3]</p>

                        headquarters. Bastar is bounded on the northwest by Narayanpur District, on the north by
                        Kondagaon district, on the east by Nabarangpur and Koraput Districts of Odisha State, on the

                        Odia culture.

                        Bastar and Dantewada districts were formerly part of the princely state of Bastar. Bastar was
                        founded in the early 14th century, by Annama Deva, the brother of Kakatiya King Pratapa Rudra
                        Deva of Warangal in Telangana. After India achieved independence in 1947, the princely states of
                        Bastar and Kanker acceded to the Government of India, and were merged to form Bastar district of
                        Madhya Pradesh. The district, which had an area of 39,114 km2 (15,102 sq mi), was one of the
                        largest in India when formed.

                        In 1999, the district was divided into the present-day districts of Bastar, Dantewada, and
                        Kanker. In 2000, Bastar was one of the 16 Madhya Pradesh districts that formed a part of the new
                        state of Chhattisgarh. In 2012, it was divided again to form Kondgaon district. These four
                        districts are part of Bastar Division.

                        Bastar is known for its traditional Dussehra festival.[2] The Chitrakoot and Teerathgarh
                        waterfalls are situated close to Jagdalpur.

                        Chhattisgarhi and Hindi are also spoken. It has been a tourist attraction for decades for its
                        rich diversity of flora and fauna.
